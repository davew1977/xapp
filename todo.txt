BUG: client not notified if user disconnects

DONE: BUG: create embedded object - should create an object on the server instead of locally, and

implement difference in UI updates based on whether it was "me" or someone else doing the update

implement prop priority, to allow simplified editor, which will expand for the advanced properties


add a "package" class which can extend dirmeta, but will allow providing an alias for the package name to improve usability in the editor

DONE: paste xml not working when there is a reference in the pasted object
DONE: prevent module from being a namespace for the java files
POSTPONE: (statically widened them instead) auto widen reference drop downs
DONE: figure out how to specify a special path separator
DONE: list property annotation should also apply to the generated xml

DONE: create a xapp-codegen module {
    problem here will be all the ng references
}

module structure {
    xapp-net {
        xapp-server-fwk
        xapp-common-fwk
        xapp-client-fwk
    }
    xapp-obj-server {
        xapp-obj-server
        xapp-obj-client
    }
    xapp-web (an adaptor to allow running xapp obj server inside a tomcat/spring mvc container
}

move ng-fwk-common to xapp-common-fwk

Lookup (net.sf.xapp.common.fwk) should be an interface.. Would be required when we have a binary serialization version of xapp -obj server

assume xml serialization of objects {
    on initial load of model
    when broadcasting new objects in the tree
}

MILESTONE
first version {
    no storage except for a periodic check in
    xml for client server transport (on top of binary protocol "objadded" "objremoved" etc
    obj ids last per jvm, checked in model does not persist object ids

}
